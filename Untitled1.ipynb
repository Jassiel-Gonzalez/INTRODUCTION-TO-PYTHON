        "\n",
        "### **explicit line continuation.**\n",
        "The Python declaration can be thought of as an instruction for the interpreter to resolve the expression and store its result in a variable.\n",

        "\n",
        "### **Variables in Python**\n",
        "In Python, the name of a variable cannot match the names of the commands assigned to this programming language and must not contain blanks.\n",
        "\n",
        "In other words, a variable cannot be called **\"print\"** since this is one of the commands assigned to Python, also, it cannot be called **\"na me\"** since it contains a blank space.\n",

        "In variables that store text, they are called *** string (str). ***\n",
